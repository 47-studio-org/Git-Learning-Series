# Accessing Code in the Cloud with GitHub
In this lesson, we’ll go over the basics of Git and GitHub by experimenting with the remote repository that this guide is hosted on. Remember, the remote repository is a copy of the code that lives in the cloud, so we need to make a clone on each device we are using for development. This allows for synchronization of your code across all your machines, and the functionality is seamlessly built into Visual Studio.

## Cloning a Repo
Let’s start by opening a new tab in your web browser and navigating to the main page of this repository. Now click the green Code drop down button on the Code tab and copy the repository URL.

| Clone this repo to your local machine with Visual Studio | [Verify](images/answer2.png) | 3 min |  How to clone a repo in Visual Studio | [Clone a repo in Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/version-control/git-clone-repository?view=vs-2022) |


## Running the Solution
Once Visual Studio finishes cloning, open the Intro to Version Control with GitHub solution by going to Solution Explorer and clicking on Files.sln. After the solution loads, we will need to set the Files.Package project as a startup project by right clicking it as shown below.
