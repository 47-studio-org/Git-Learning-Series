# Accessing Code in the Cloud with GitHub
In this lesson, we’ll go over the basics of Git and GitHub by experimenting with the remote repository that this guide is hosted on. Remember, the remote repository is a copy of the code that lives in the cloud, so we need to make a clone on each device we are using for development. This allows for synchronization of your code across all your machines, and the functionality is seamlessly built into Visual Studio.

## Cloning a Repo
Let’s start by opening a new tab in your web browser and navigating to the main page of this repository. Now click the green Code drop down button on the Code tab and copy the repository URL.

Open Visual Studio and select the Clone a repository option under the Get started section. Paste the repository URL to the Repository location text box and click the clone button.
